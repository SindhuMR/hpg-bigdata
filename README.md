# How to build
HPG BigData is mainly developed in Java and it uses [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as building tool. HPG BigData requires Java 8 and others OpenCB Java dependencies that can be found in [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/).

Stable releases are merged and tagged at **_master_** branch, you are encourage to use latest stable release for production. Current active development is carried out at **_develop_** branch, only compilation is guaranteed and bugs are expected, use this branch for development or for testing new functionalities. Only dependencies of **_master_** branch are ensured to be deployed at [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/), **_develop_** branch may require users to download and install other active OpenCB repositories:

* _GA4GH_: https://github.com/opencb/ga4gh (branch 'master')
* _java-common-libs_: https://github.com/opencb/java-common-libs (branch 'develop')
* _biodata_: https://github.com/opencb/biodata (branch 'develop')

To build the application, run `./build.sh` on the main folder. It will create a new folder **build**. Find the launch scripts on **build/bin**, and some examples on **build/examples**.

### System requirements
These are other requirements:

* Java 1.8
* cmake, g++
* Libraries: libz, libsnappy, liblzma, libncurses


### Cloning
HPG BigData is an open-source and free project, you can download **_develop_** branch by executing:

    imedina@ivory:~$ git clone https://github.com/opencb/hpg-bigdata.git
